# COVID-19 Tracker: A Journey from React to Next.js 🚀

Welcome to the **COVID-19 Tracker** repository, a project that has evolved over 4 years from its humble beginnings to a cutting-edge, open-source platform. This project started with plain React in 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. Today, it has been **revolutionized** with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Mapbox**, **Radix UI**, and a modern CI/CD pipeline through **Vercel**.

## 🌟 Why the Upgrade?

Four years ago, the focus was speed and simplicity, built using tools like:
- **React** (no TypeScript)
- **Material UI**
- **Leaflet.js** for maps
- Minimal or no SEO optimization

Today, we’ve rebuilt this platform to reflect modern best practices, ensuring **better performance**, **SEO**, and **developer experience**.

### What’s New? ✨

### **Next.js**: Bringing Superpowers to React 🦸‍♂️
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Faster initial page loads and improved performance, crucial for mobile users on slower networks. 
- **SEO Optimization**: SSR means better **search engine indexing**, helping more people find valuable COVID-19 data. 
- **API Routes**: Seamless integration for building backend functionality directly in Next.js.
- **Page-based Routing**: Simplifying navigation with intuitive file-based routing.

### **TypeScript**: Type Safety 🛡️ for Peace of Mind
- Writing code with **TypeScript** eliminates common bugs by ensuring **type safety**. Less time is spent debugging, and the codebase is more robust. 

### **Mapbox**: From 2D to WebGL-Powered Maps 🗺️
- Originally built with **Leaflet.js**, the maps have been upgraded to **Mapbox**, leveraging **WebGL** for faster, more interactive, and **dynamic visualizations**.
- Support for layers, custom markers, and heatmaps brings **rich data visualization** for COVID-19 stats.

### **Radix UI**: Modern, Accessible Components 🎨
- We’ve transitioned from **Material UI** to **Radix UI**, bringing a lightweight, **accessible**, and highly customizable component library, ensuring both performance and **design consistency**.

### **Vercel**: Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ⚡
- This project is hosted and deployed on **Vercel**, providing automated builds and instant deployments every time you push updates. It ensures that the project is always live with **zero downtime**.
  
### **Open Source** 🌍
- This project is **open source**! Feel free to fork, contribute, and make it better. Together, we can build a more informed world.
